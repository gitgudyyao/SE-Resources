To send a process to background, press Ctrl+Z
Example, press Ctrl+Z while using nano will send it to background and return to the prompt

If there is only one background process, we can use the fg command to bring back the process
If there are a few background processes, fg will bring back the most recently working process.
To list all background processes, use the jobs command.
To bring a process, use the job ID in fg command, for example to bring back nano: fg 1

Ubuntu 16.04 uses systemd for init system. It uses systemctl command to manage services.
Ubuntu 14.04 and earlier use Upstart for init system. It uses service command to manage services. Examples:
service ssh status
service ssh stop

Some services are started by the scripts in /etc/init.d/, not by Upstart or systemd commands. Examples
/etc/init.d/ssh start
/etc/init.d/ssh stop
/etc/init.d/ssh status
/etc/init.d/ssh reload

To kill a process, use the kill command. By default, kill will send SIGTERM (value=15) signal to the process.
If SIGTERM unable to terminate a process, then we can forcibly terminate the process by sending the SIGKILL signal (value=9).
Examples
kill 2634 (this will send SIGTERM signal to process 2634)
kill -9 2644 (this will send SIGKILL signal to process 2644)

list only TCP connections: netstat -at
list only UDP connections: netstat -au
display IPv6 routing table: netstat -rn -A inet6

nmap – explore network, scan port
nmap IP //nmap 192.168.30.102
nmap domain //sudo nmap polarbear
nmap -p port_number IP_range //sudo nmap -p 80 192.168.30.100-120
